## Introduction:

**smtpMailerOOo** is a [LibreOffice](https://fr.libreoffice.org/download/telecharger-libreoffice/) and/or [OpenOffice](https://www.openoffice.org/fr/Telecharger/) extension allowing to offer you innovative services in these office suites.  
This extension allows you to send electronic mail in LibreOffice / OpenOffice, possibly by mail merge, to your telephone contacts.

Being free software I encourage you:

In short, to participate in the development of this extension.
Because it is together that we can make Free Software smarter.

## Historical:

What remains to be done:

- Rewriting of mailmerge.py (to be compatible with: SSL and StartTLS, OAuth2 authentication... ie: with Mozilla IspBD technology)
- Write an Wizard using Mozilla IspDB technology able to find the correct configuration working with mailmerge.py.
- Rewriting of Mailer Dialog.py in a Mailer Wizard dialog.
